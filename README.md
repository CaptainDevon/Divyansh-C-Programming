# C++ Learning Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my C++ repository! This repository is a collection of my projects, exercises, and notes as I have progressed through learning C++. Here, you'll find my explorations into various aspects of the language, including Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the Standard Template Library (STL), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Concurrent Programming, and other fundamental concepts.

## Introduction
C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language widely used for system/software development, game development, and in performance-critical applications. It is known for its versatility and efficiency, making it a popular choice among developers.

## Fundamentals
In this section, you will find my notes and examples covering the basics of C++ programming:
- Syntax and structure of a C++ program
- Variables and data types
- Operators and expressions
- Control statements (if, switch, loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Pointers and memory management

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
C++ is renowned for its strong support for Object-Oriented Programming. Here, I delve into:
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Constructors and destructors

## Standard Template Library (STL)
The STL is a powerful feature of C++ that provides a set of common classes and interfaces for data structures and algorithms. Topics include:
- Containers (vector, list, deque, set, map, etc.)
- Iterators
- Algorithms (sort, search, transform, etc.)
- Function objects (functors)

## Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Understanding DSA is crucial for efficient problem-solving and optimizing code. This section includes:
- Arrays and strings
- Linked lists
- Stacks and queues
- Trees and graphs
- Hashing
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Complexity analysis

## Concurrent Programming
This section covers the basics of concurrent programming in C++ using threads. Concurrent programming is essential for improving the performance of applications by enabling them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. Topics include:
- Introduction to threads
- Creating and managing threads
- Synchronization and locking mechanisms
- Avoiding race conditions and deadlock
- Using the `std::thread` library

Folder: `Concurrent programming`

## Projects
To apply what I've learned, I've built several projects that showcase my skills:
- **Flight Management System**: A CLI-based application to manage flight reservations, built using OOP principles.

## Conclusion
C++ is a language that offers immense power and flexibility, and mastering it is a rewarding endeavor. This repository is a testament to my journey through the intricacies of C++ programming. I hope it serves as a helpful resource for others embarking on a similar path.
